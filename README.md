# podskim
A podcast skimmer written in Go  

The basic idea is to get all of my podcast feeds into one page where you can easily download the new items without having to have separate podcatcher applications. 

This repo contains the Go source and necessary web files
 * static - javascript and css
 * tmpl - templates for the html

Designed to live in ~/podskim

Podskim makes use of [Picorss](https://github.com/stevenewbs/picorss) to break open the Xml
